# battleships
PHP and JavaScript driven Battleships game 
This game was created for a university module on Web Applications Development, we began the module by creating a PHP driven and command line interface blackjack or 21 card game.
The battleships game is in its final iteration for the class, but I'm gonna turn update it and make it salvo, with point and hit counters 

I think the meaning of using a turn based game like battleships for an introduction to web applications, was a very clever way of teaching us about the security implications of server and client side technologies, it's easy to give the game away if one language is spilling the beans
